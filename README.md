# The Data set used
We'll be using the following dataset to apply Linear Regression.

| Age |	Number of Driver Deaths per 100,000
|-----|-----
| 17.5 |	38
|22|	36
|29.5|	24
|44.5|	20
|64.5|	18
|80	| 28

We'll try to determine an equation that can be used to predict the number of deaths for any age.

# The equation

The general equation found is in the following format

y = -0.19*X + 35.58
